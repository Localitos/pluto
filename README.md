# Pluto - Localyze Design System

<p align="center"><img src="public/pluto.webp?raw=true" /></p>

Pluto is a design system used to build accessible, consistent, and high quality public-facing experiences at Localyze.

## Getting Started

ðŸ‘‹ Hi. Follow the steps below to begin building with Pluto

### 1. Install external dependencies

| Package   | Version |
| --------- | ------- |
| react     | 18.x    |
| react-dom | 18.x    |

```shell npm2yarn
npm install --save react react-dom
```

### 2. Install Pluto packages

Install the following packages so you can consume Pluto's tokens and themes to build custom page sections.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save @localyze-pluto/theme @localyze-pluto/components
```

#### Fonts

Currently we only offer have one font family (Moderat) for use within Localyze applications. The Moderat font files must be loaded in the Localyze application because of licensing. We're open to the idea of offering an open source font with Pluto. If you have any ideas on which fonts to offer, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/Localitos/pluto/discussions/new).

### 3. Build some cool stuff.

Enough said.
