## Getting Started

ðŸ‘‹ Hi. Follow the steps below to begin building with Pluto

### 1. Install external dependencies

| Package   | Version |
| --------- | ------- |
| react     | 18.x    |
| react-dom | 18.x    |

```shell npm2yarn
npm install --save react react-dom
```

### 2. Install Pluto packages

```

### 3. Build some cool stuff.

Enough said.

### 4. Feedback

## Generators

This repo leverage [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) to help scaffold out the files that you need when you're creating a new component.

### New Components

Running `yarn add-component` will create the folder and files you need to start building out your component. Each component at the very least should have an export, documentation, testing, and a story file.

## Releases

TODO: Change this section to reflect publishing on NPM with Changesets.

1. Create a [Github Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with packages permissions.
2. Login into Github Packages (the password should be the token created on the step before)

```
npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

3. Create a `~/.npmrc` file
