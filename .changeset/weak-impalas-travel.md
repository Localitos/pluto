[Tabs]:

> Breaking changes:
>
> - Removed the `flexed` prop from the Tabs component, as it is now the default behavior.
> - Removed the `variant` prop from the Tabs component since it wasn't used in the component.

- Minor changes:
  - The `TabsList` component now accepts a `fullWidth` prop allowing the tabs list to expand to the full width.
  - Fixed a bug with the focus indicator, switching from focus to focus-visible for better accessibility.
  - Fixed styles of the Tabs to be more consistent with Figma
