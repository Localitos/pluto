[ContentCard]

> Breaking change: `iconUrl` prop is now `topLeftElement` and accepts a ReactNode

Minor changes:

- Set Icon wrapper border radius to 8px (shows now like a square)
- Added new `topRightElement` prop to allow add element in the top right corner of the card
- Added new `lowOpacity` prop to set the opacity of the card content without include the `topRightElement`
- Fixed styles: heading color, card content
